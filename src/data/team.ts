    bio: "<p>After completing my studies in fashion design at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, I decided to return to Buffalo. However, I encountered difficulties starting a fashion career in Buffalo that would allow me to utilize my fashion design degree. Drawing from my upbringing which was heavily focused in real estate, I instinctively entered into the field, but I’ve always maintained the creative spirit to design, sew, express myself through fashion and celebrate style.</p><p>The birth of fig™ has been a catalyst to re-energize my creative pursuits and inspired me to contribute to Buffalo's fashion scene. Over the years, I have cultivated relationships with fellow artists, event visionaries, and fashion designers who share the same passion.  I launched an intimate wear collection at fig™ 2023 called SCOTT free. </p><p>The fig™ team's synergy, combined with the energy of other pop-up fashion events, is set to ignite a fashion movement in Buffalo that we have all been eagerly anticipating. Together, we are poised to celebrate style, cultivate a vibrant fashion community, and shape Buffalo's future in the world of fashion.</p>",

    bio: '<p>For many decades, Buffalonians supported a host of unheralded fashion designers, who were part of the cultural landscape of the city. They were the unsung heroes who reflected the style and taste of a variety of ethnicities and religions. Central to neighborhoods, seamstresses and tailors not only cut, sewed and altered clothing, but designed stylish outfits for their clients. For life’s big events, elegant bridal stores often designed and made the bride’s gown and the bridal party’s dresses. Lining Fillmore Avenue for decades, Frances Bridal, Clara Milas and other shops were loved and respected by generations of devotees. Gary White, the famed hat maker, who is still creating today, added to the artistry of the Eastside from his shop on Broadway. It was also common for these local artisans to create First Communion dresses for the Christian tradition, prom dresses, and even costumes for children’s dance recitals. As a marketing executive with proven expertise in driving revenue by building innovative strategies for brand development, thought leadership, advertising, communications, special events, and community partnerships, I hope to bring attention to the new wave of fashion designers, helping them to achieve the recognition they deserve—in Buffalo and beyond.<p>',
